The Movie Data Management Project using SQL  involves creating a database to store and manage movie-related information such as titles, actors, directors, genres, and ratings. It uses SQL for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data, with relationships between entities, allowing efficient retrieval and analysis of movie data.
